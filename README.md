# ChameleonRT

[![CMake](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

An example path tracer that runs on multiple ray tracing backends (Embree/DXR/OptiX/Vulkan/Metal/OSPRay).
Uses [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader) to load OBJ files,
[tinygltf](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf) to load glTF files and, optionally,
Ingo Wald's [pbrt-parser](https://github.com/ingowald/pbrt-parser) to load PBRTv3 files.
The San Miguel,
Sponza and Rungholt models shown below are from Morgan McGuire's [Computer Graphics Data Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data/).

Binaries built for each platform with support for all rendering backends available on that platform
can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/releases) or the latest [Actions](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/actions) artifacts.
On Linux set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the directory where you extract the
application, on macOS do the same for `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. On macOS you may need to do some
tweaking/security allowances to get the application to run. Only x86_64 binaries are provided for macOS at the moment.

## Controls

The camera is an arcball camera that moves around the camera's focal point.

- Zoom in/out using the mousewheel. (Two-finger scroll motion on MacBook Pro etc. trackpad.)
- Click and drag to rotate.
- Right-click and drag to pan. (Two-finger click and drag on MacBook Pro etc. trackpad.)

Keys while the application window is in focus:

- Print the current camera position, center point, up vector and field of view (FOV) to the terminal by pressing the `p` key.
- Save image by pressing the `s` key.

## Command-line Options

```text
-eye <x> <y> <z>       Set the camera position
-center <x> <y> <z>    Set the camera focus point
-up <x> <y> <z>        Set the camera up vector
-fov <fovy>            Specify the camera field of view (in degrees)
-camera <n>            If the scene contains multiple cameras, specify which
                       should be used. Defaults to the first camera
-img <x> <y>           Specify the window dimensions. Defaults to 1280x720
```

## Ray Tracing Backends  

The currently implemented backends are: Embree, DXR, OptiX, Vulkan, and Metal.
When running the program, you can pick which backend you want from
those you compiled with on the command line. Running the program with no
arguments will print help information.

```
./chameleonrt <backend> <mesh.obj/gltf/glb>
```

All five ray tracing backends use [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) for window management
and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for math.
If CMake doesn't find your SDL2 install you can point it to the root
of your SDL2 directory by passing `-DSDL2_DIR=<path>`. GLM will be automatically
downloaded by CMake during the build process.

To track statistics about the number of rays traced per-second
run CMake with `-DREPORT_RAY_STATS=ON`. Tracking these statistics can
impact performance slightly.

ChameleonRT only supports per-OBJ group/mesh materials, OBJ files using per-face materials
can be reexported from Blender with the "Material Groups" option enabled.

To build with PBRT file support set `-DpbrtParser_DIR=<path>` to the CMake export files for
your build of the [pbrt-parser](https://github.com/ingowald/pbrt-parser).

### Embree

Dependencies: [Embree](https://embree.github.io/),
[TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) and [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/).

To build the Embree backend run CMake with:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_EMBREE=ON \
	-Dembree_DIR=<path to embree-config.cmake> \
	-DTBB_DIR=<path TBBConfig.cmake> \
	-DISPC_DIR=<path to ispc>
```

You can then pass `embree` to use the Embree backend. The `TBBConfig.cmake` will
be under `<tbb root>/cmake`, while `embree-config.cmake` is in the root of the
Embree directory.

### OptiX

Dependencies: [OptiX 7.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix), [CUDA 11](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).

To build the OptiX backend run CMake with:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_OPTIX=ON
```

You can then pass `optix` to use the OptiX backend.

If CMake doesn't find your install of OptiX you can tell it where
it's installed with `-DOptiX_INSTALL_DIR`.

### DirectX Ray Tracing

If you're on Windows 10 1809 or higher, have the latest Windows 10 SDK installed and a DXR
capable GPU you can also run the DirectX Ray Tracing backend.

To build the DXR backend run CMake with:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_DXR=ON
```

You can then pass `dxr` to use the DXR backend.

### Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing

Dependencies: [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (SDK 1.2.162 or higher)

To build the Vulkan backend run CMake with:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_VULKAN=ON
```

You can then pass `vulkan` to use the Vulkan backend.

If CMake doesn't find your install of Vulkan you can tell it where it's
installed with `-DVULKAN_SDK`. This path should be to the specific version
of Vulkan, for example: `-DVULKAN_SDK=<path>/VulkanSDK/<version>/`

### Metal

Dependencies: [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) and a macOS 11+ device that supports ray tracing.

To build the Metal backend run CMake with:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_METAL=ON
```

You can then pass `metal` to use the Metal backend.

### OSPRay

Dependencies: [OSPRay 2.0](http://www.ospray.org/), [TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/).

To build the OSPRay backend run CMake with:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_OSPRAY=ON -Dospray_DIR=<path to osprayConfig.cmake>
```

You may also need to specify OSPRay's dependencies,
[ospcommon](https://github.com/ospray/ospcommon) and [OpenVKL](https://github.com/openvkl/openvkl),
depending on how you got or built the OSPRay binaries.
If you downloaded the OSPRay release binaries, you just need to
specify that path.

You can then pass `ospray` to use the OSPRay backend.
